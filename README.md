## Beaver IoT Integrations
Integrations are the primary means for Beaver IoT to interact with third-party services, devices, platforms, etc., enabling device connectivity, device control, and feature expansion.

## Start building your integrations

The following is the directory structure of this project.

```

  │ ├── sample-integrations/                    # Sample integration directory
  │ │   └── ...                                 # Sample integrations
  │ ├── msc-integration                         # Milesight Developer Platform integration
  │ └──...                                      # Other integrations

If you want to develop your own integration, please create a new integration package under the `beaver-iot-integrations/integrations/` directory.
